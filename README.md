# mobile-conversion-app

This is the basic conversion application.

This app will check your input value and several conditions before converting to destination units.
I don't add all the formulars into this app, so you can develop the application in many ways, such as by adding formularies, conversion parameters, and backgrounds.

This is just a course, so I can implement more tools and features for this app.

Thank you for reading and practising.
